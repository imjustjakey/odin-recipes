        <ul>
            1/2 cups whole milk or half-and-half
        </ul>
        <ul>
            cup sour cream
        </ul>
        <ul>
            (8 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed

            Directions
            <li>
                Gather all ingredients.
                Place half of angel food cake pieces in the bottom of a deep 8-x-8-inch or 9x9-inch baking dish in an
                even
                layer. Spread 1 cup cherry pie filling over top of cake. Top with remaining cake pieces in an even
                layer.
            </li>

            <li>
                Whisk together vanilla pudding mix, whole milk, and sour cream in a large bowl until slightly thickened
                and
                smooth, about 1 minute.
            </li>
            Pour pudding mix over top of cake and spread evenly.
            <li>
                Spread thawed whipped topping over pudding layer. Dot with remaining 1 cup cherry pie filling. Using a
                toothpick
                or spoon, swoop and swirl pie filling into the whipped topping. Refrigerate, uncovered, for at least 8
                hours
                or
                up to 12 hours. Garnish with sliced almonds.
