        Ingredients
        <ul>
            8 ounces lasagna noodles, broken in half
        </ul>
        <ul>
            1 (24-ounce) jar tomato sauce
        </ul>
        <ul>
            8 ounces shredded whole milk mozzarella cheese

            Directions
            <li>
                Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring
                occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 10 to 12 minutes.
            </li>

            <li>
                Strain noodles and return to the pot. Add tomato sauce and cook on medium heat until sauce is heated
                through, about 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add cheese and stir until cheese is melted. Serve immediately.
            </li>
